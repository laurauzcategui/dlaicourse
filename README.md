# Tensorflow In Practice Specialization

This repository contains the work and other tools for working through Cousera's Tensorflow in Practice Specialization facilitated by Laurence Moroney.

## Environment Setup

There is multiple ways to work with Tensorflow, we will highlighted here in order of complexity from easiest to hardest, you could: 

1. Using [Google Colabs tool](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), an awesome free tool provided by Google to do Research & Development with notebooks.

1. Install it yourself, you can read more about it in the [Tensorflow Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

2. If you like building your own stuff, you could use Docker containers, checkout the guide we have prepared for using Tensorflow in Docker with Jupyter integrated. Checkout this guide [Setup Tensorflow in Docker Container](#Docker-Container-Setup) by [Laura Uzcategui](http://uzcategui.dev)

## Tensorflow In Practice Modules 

In this section we will highlight where you will be able to find the notebooks relevant to the module ( course ) and week you are taking in the specialization.
